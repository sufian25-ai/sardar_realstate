# Property Controller Creation Tasks

- [x] Create PropertyController.php in realstate-backend/app/Http/Controllers/API/
  - [x] Implement index method with filtering (type, stype, city, state, price range, status, featured, verified)
  - [x] Implement store method with validation for all fillable fields
  - [x] Implement show method to display single property with relationships
  - [x] Implement update method with validation
  - [x] Implement destroy method with checks for related records
- [x] Test the controller methods (routes verified in api.php)

# API and Frontend Fixes

- [x] Fix API endpoint mismatch: Change frontend AuthContext to call '/get-user' instead of '/user-info'
- [x] Update backend AuthenticationController@userInfo to return authenticated user instead of paginated user list
- [x] Fix properties not showing on Properties page: Improve backend filtering logic and make properties index/show public routes
- [x] Make Properties page publicly accessible in frontend routing
- [ ] Investigate React jsx prop warning if it persists after API fix
